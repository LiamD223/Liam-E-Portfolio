<h2>About Me</h2>
<P>My name is Liam Daya and I have taken a grade 9 course in business technology that has taught me useful skills I use to make my work more efficient. For example, this E-Portfolio has been created by myself using “HTML5” and this about me section has been drafted using proper typing key placement and ergonomics to keep myself safe and capable of completing more work at faster speeds than someone without my class’ education. In the future I plan on joining the legal field which will require me to be able to sit down and draft large legal documents for each one of my clients in order to accommodate their goals or circumstances.</P>
