<i><a href="Task #2 Payroll.xlsx">Spreadsheet Test</a></i>
  <p>This test showcases both my understanding and my ability to calculate the gross pay, taxes, netpay and totals using the correct formulas. I am also capable of changing the design and appearance of my spreadsheet using tools and skills I've learnt in my business course  such as  formatting columns and rows along with using bold, center, and displaying dollar values with two decimal places making my spreadsheet look visually appealing and professional. The spreadsheet test helps me practice the catholic social teaching “Call to Family, Community and Participation” as spreadsheets are a tool used to organize our society and help people maintain the common good and their well-being. </p>

<i><a href="Ms Word.pdf">Typing Test</a></i>
 <p>During this unit, I corrected the way I typed on my keyboard along with my posture. Practicing the correct way to sit and type will prevent me from having any long term medical conditions that may affect my ability to get work done. It’s important that my business keeps my employees safe and productive and with my knowledge of ergonomics and typing, I'd be able to ensure my workers a job that allows them to be successful and healthy. I think the typing test helps me practice the catholic social teaching about Rights and Responsibilities as this lesson ensures that the community i’d be forming with the launch of my business would stay healthy and protected under my employ.</p>

<i><a href="Letter 1 to CEO.pdf">Proper Letter/Email Format </a></i>
  <p>This letter demonstrates my understanding of effective business communication as it covers all of the concepts we learned in class that were required to create a proper letter/email. The letter included the complimentary close, spacing and date as well as a letterhead. As a result of this exercise, I am now capable of creating a professional letter and poster using electronic tools and templates. Having a communication skill like this will help me make a good impression on future employers and effectively deliver my messages about business related ventures.The letter/email helps me practice the catholic social teaching “Call to Family, Community and Participation” as it is a form of communication used to keep a business organized and on the same page about ideas and beliefs. These letters unite people who would otherwise not talk to each other and unintentionally makes them a community that looks out for each other and their well-being.</p>

<i><a href="Let's Name Some Files.pdf">Naming Files Activity </a></i>
  <p>The naming files activity helps me stay more organized and it taught me how to keep my files secure and readily available by adding a subject, date and title to the file name for example, Math_Grade9_GeometryTest_2024. By practicing naming my files like this I make my files more secure while also making them easier to find/categorize. For someone like me who knows the contents of the file and the information about it like the date, it will be easier to find, but it can also ensure no intruders have access to any important files on my computer. Demonstrating this skill to a future employer shows responsibility and organization which are both qualities that help people be promoted to management positions and if that doesn’t happen at least I will be able to make a good impression on my boss which could still open up other avenues and opportunities for me. Naming files like this is another way that I can practice the catholic social teaching, “The Dignity of Work and the Rights of Workers”, as files are used as a way to create something and contribute more to God’s creation. Furthermore, naming files properly like I’ve learned is a good way to do productive work and taking initiative, in this way we are truly practicing “The Dignity of Work and the Rights of Workers”.</p>

<i><a href="Consolidation.pdf">How Technology Has Advanced </a></i>
  <p>The knowledge I have about technology's impact on today’s society is going to help me determine the job field I plan on entering. This assignment taught me how much technology helps people in hospitals get the care they need alongside the doctors and nurses that are there for them. Having this knowledge will influence my business ventures to take a more technology related approach as technology is something that only advances and will never go away. The benefits of technology outweigh the concerns that the general public has, so having a tech influenced business is a good investment because technology will always be in demand. This would be practicing the catholic social teaching, “life and dignity of the human person”, as technology is a thing that exists to help make humans lives easier and this social teaching teaches us that humans are very precious and more important than things which is why technology only exists to serve humans.</p>

<i><a href="Plagarism.pdf">Taking a look at different plagarism policies </a></i>
  <p>Knowing all of these plagiarism policies can help me stay out of legal trouble as plagiarizing is essentially just stealing someone else's work and claiming it as your own. I want a future with promise and by plagiarizing, I will be denied opportunities regarding jobs and education which is why it is important that I have this knowledge now so that I know to stop myself from making a mistake as big and harmful to myself as plagiarism in the future. This knowledge can also help my business stay original and build an audience that we can cater specifically towards making my business unique and special. If I avoid plagiarism my business will also not have to give credit elsewhere for its success and I will not have to worry about paying royalties and other fees to people whose work I utilized. Generally, avoiding plagiarism will save me and my business from having lots of problems in the future. When we avoid plagiarism we are practicing the catholic social teaching, “Rights and Responsibilities”, as ones work is protected and that is one way we fulfill our responsibilities to one another.</p>

<i><a href="Task 2 - Design a New Workstation.pdf">Ergonomics Workstation </a></i>
  <p>This exercise taught me to research and invest into good products to create a safe and productive work environment for ourselves. Health problems like eye strain, carpal tunnel syndrome and more can be avoided by just practicing good ergonomics and using the right tools to help you do so. Knowing this will be especially important for when I start my own business as I can promise my employees a job where they can be successful and remain healthy/safe.</p>
